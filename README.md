### Hi there 🙋‍♂️

My name is Nilesh, I am a web developer currently working as a freelancer in the same domain. I am passionate about photography, fictional literature and programming competitions. In my spare time you will probably find me reading a book or participating in a coding contest.

PS. - I also like Maths. :smile:
